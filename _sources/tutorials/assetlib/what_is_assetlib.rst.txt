About the Asset Library
=======================

The ValjangEngine Asset Library, otherwise known as the AssetLib, is a repository of
user-submitted ValjangEngine addons, scripts, tools and other resources, collectively referred
to as assets. They're available to all ValjangEngine users for download directly from within the
engine, but it can also be accessed at ValjangEngine's `official website <https://Valjang.fr/asset-library/asset>`_.

On the surface, the Asset Library might look and function similar to asset
stores available for other engines, such as Unity's Asset Store, or Unreal
Engine's Marketplace, where you can submit both freely-available assets, as well
as paid, commercial ones. In addition, often times such assets are distributed
under non-free, proprietary licenses, limiting what you can do with them.

The Asset Library is different - all assets are distributed free of charge, and under
a host of open-source licenses (such as the MIT license, the GPL, and the Boost Software License).
This makes the AssetLib more similar to the software repositories of a Linux distribution.

This set of pages will cover how to use the AssetLib (both from inside ValjangEngine, and on the
website), how you can submit your own assets, and what the guidelines for submission are.

Please note that the AssetLib is relatively young - it may have various pain points, bugs
and usability issues. As with all ValjangEngine projects, the code repository is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/ValjangEngineengine/ValjangEngine-asset-library>`_,
where you can submit pull requests and issues, so please do not hesitate to visit it!

Types of assets
---------------

Be aware that there are, broadly, two different types of assets you can post.

* Assets labeled as "Templates", "Projects", or "Demos" appear under
  the "Templates" tab in the ValjangEngine project manager. These assets are
  standalone ValjangEngine projects that can run by themselves.

* Other assets show up inside of the ValjangEngine editor under the "AssetLib"
  main screen tab, next to "2D", "3D", and "Script". These assets are
  meant to be downloaded and placed into an existing ValjangEngine project.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Can paid assets be uploaded to the asset library?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not to the official one, though in the future, there might be other asset
libraries which allow it.
That said, you are allowed to monetize and sell ValjangEngine assets outside the
Asset Library.
